Systematic identification of smORFs in domestic silkworm (Bombyx mori) 

The silkworm (Bombyx mori) is not only an excellent model species, but also an important agricultural economic insect. Taking it as the research object, its advantages of low maintenance cost and no biohazard risks are considered. Small open reading frames (smORFs) are an important class of genomic elements that can produce bioactive peptides. However, the smORFs in silkworm had been poorly identified and studied. To further study the smORFs in silkworm, systematic genome-wide identification is essential. Here, we identified and analyzed smORFs in the silkworm using a comprehensive methods. Our results showed that at least 738 highly reliable smORFs were found in B. mori and that 34,401 possible smORFs were partially supported. We also identified some differentially expressed and tissue-specific-expressed smORFs, which may be closely related to the characteristics and functions of the tissues. This article provides a basis for subsequent research on smORFs in silkworm, and also hopes to provide a reference point for future research methods for smORFs in other species.
